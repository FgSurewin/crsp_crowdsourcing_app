<center><strong>ðŸ˜ƒCrowdsourcing Web App Based on React<strong></center>

:new:Doorfront is an out-of-the-box crowdsourcing web application that provides you a easy approach to collect your own label data. With this tool, you can simply set up your personal crowdsourcing app byâ€‹ :zap: few lines of code.

# Background

Based on a report by NYC MOPD, there are almost 1 million New Yorkers who have self-disclosed living with a disability or roughly 11.2% of the cityâ€™s population. MOPD also estimates that approximately 6.8 million visitors to our city each year have a disability. We propose a solution to create a large-scale open-source semantic map layer of NYC sidewalks and storefronts using a hybrid approach of machine learning and crowdsourcing, with close community engagement. In this project, we focus on developing a crowdsourcing web application that enables online crowd-workers as well as volunteers to remotely help label image data

# Features

:memo:This is an integrated version, which means it has both a sign-up/login pages and landing page. If you prefer to customizing your own landing page as well as other pages, you can just install our label tool :fire: which has been separated from the project and released by NPM (You can get more [info](#Built with package) below).

- [x] Landing page
- [x] Sign-up & Login
- [x] Built in Google Streetview
- [x] Integrated MongoDB database
- [ ] Fully support TypeScript
- [ ] Integrated other databases

## Features of Label Tool

- [x] Zoom in and out of images
- [x] Resize bounding box
- [x] Transfer bounding box
- [x] Custom context menu
- [x] Integrated manipulation panel

# Install

:hear_no_evil:You can clone this repo or download the ZIP file.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/FgSurewin/crsp_crowdsourcing_app.git
```

# Usage

:construction_worker:Since this project was developed based on Node, you should install all the third party packages before you run this project. Please make sure you download Node.js on your machine.

```bash
# In the root directory
$ npm install

# Go to /app directory
$ cd app

# In the /app directory
$ npm install
```

To enable Google Streetview and MongoDB, you have to provide two API keys and store them as environment variables because of the security problem. (More info about [Google key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/zh-cn/cloud/atlas))

```bash
# Create an .env file in server folder and save the statement shown below
WEB_LINK=Your Database Connection Link

# Create an .env file in app folder and save the statement shown below
REACT_APP_API_KEY=Your Google API key
```

### Developed Mode

After you configured all the requirements, you can run the project now:heart:.

```bash
# Run the project
$ npm run dev
```

### Production Mode

When you gonna deploy the project, you need to run build command to build your project

```bash
# Firstly, you should build the frontend project first
$ npm run app-build

# Now, you can build the whole project
$ npm run build

# You can also test it by saying
$ npm start
```

# Built with package

Like I mentioned before, label tool has been separated and released via NPM. Therefore, you can easily install the label tool and integrate it into your project without other pages.

```bash
# install the label tool in your project
$ npm install --save @fgsurewin/react_labeltool
```
